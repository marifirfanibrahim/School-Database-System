This is a system that manages a school database. The system can enroll students into the school system, retrieve the teacher's information, and access/modify the student grades by using anonymous blocks, functions, and procedures.

This database comprises of 6 tables. These are:
1. teacher
2. enrollment
3. student
4. grade
5. subject

Here, these tables are dropped and then created. Next, they are filled with relevant values.
In this system, as of now, there are 8 basic queries (select, insert, delete, update), 2 functions, 2 procedures, and 3 anonymous blocks.

- 1 anonymous block calls for 1 function to fetch the values of an entity from an existing table.
- 1 anonymous block calls for 1 procedure to insert new values into an existing table.
- 1 anonymous block calls for 1 procedure that call for a function to display the grades of a specific student, where the function serves to combine the student's first name and last name.
